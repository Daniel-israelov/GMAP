# GMAP

Check the app at - https://gmapisrael.netlify.app/index.html  
This is the final project of the course "GIS Apps Development".

The app is a dynamic map that displays all authorized garages across Israel.
By clicking on a garage icon, a pop-up will appear with the info of the clicked garage.
Navigation to the selected location will redirect to google maps.
